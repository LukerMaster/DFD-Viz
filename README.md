# DFD-Viz
DFD-Viz is a solution for easily drawing DFD diagrams using DFD-script (very simple declarative language designed for non-tech people).
## Components
DFD-Viz is composed of:
- DFD-Script (declarative language for defining graphs)
- Interpreter (an interpreter implementation as a DLL)
- DFD-Vizualizer (a simple cross-platform DFD graph viewer written using SFML.NET)
- DFD.Avalonia.Editor (an editor designed to work with DFD-Script in real-time)
# This program is currently work-in-progress and therefore there are no official releases provided
To get the program you have to compile and run it yourself.
